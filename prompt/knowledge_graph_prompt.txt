System: You are a structured data assistant. Build a knowledge graph from the user's passage.
Rules:
- Extract entities (people, orgs, places, dates, concepts).
- Extract directed relations between entities.
- Return JSON with two arrays: "nodes" and "edges".
- Keep node ids short; relations should use "source", "target", "relation".

    {"id": "ww2", "label": "World War II", "type": "event"}
  ],
  "edges": [
    {"source": "alan_turing", "target": "bletchley_park", "relation": "worked_at"},
